                <h4>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Pairing is incredibly valuable.  I had wondered how DBC was able to teach as much as they do in such a short time.  After pairing a few times, I think I have my answer.  When I pair, the social aspect of the interaction helps me stay extremely focused and engaged.  On many occassions I have not known an answer but my pair did, and then just a few minutes later, I knew an answer when my pair didn't.  Together we were able to figure things out much more quickly and easier than when working by ourselves.  It was also more fun.  I believe I have made some genuine friends through pairing and it will almost feel like a reunion when I meet up with people in person at DBC.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I found it particularly rewarding to check in with people and get to know them and where they are at in their coding careers.  I got a sense of the person on the whole and it was also great to emphasize with their experience of DBC.  I ended up feeling less alone in my concerns.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Thinking of constructive criticism when I really didn't have any since I thoroughly enjoyed the peer pairing  Also, walking the fine line between anonymous feedback and nonanonymous feedback since the more specific my feedback was the more obvious it is who is giving it.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I felt surprisingly vulnerable about the feedback.  I was worried somebody would say something critical and I wondered how I would take it.  In actual fact, people were all very complimentary and I was surprised that I felt a little bashful to be flattered like that.  I did appreciate the positive feedback though.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>It was.  It was nice to see how people are experiencing my pairing style.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>How was it to write feedback? What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I found it sometimes easy to write feedback and sometimes difficult.  Everyone has been a delight to work with and have helped me learn immensely.  I feel like I'm repeating myself when I write feedback because I am always so appreciative of the companionship my peer pair gave me.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I believe it is highly effective because it keeps me motivated and engaged and it give me the opportunity to share my knowledge and learn from someone else's.  To give a speficif example, Joey taught me that I could use auto-complete in the terminal by pressing tab.  Later, that day I had a peer pairing session with Justin and I was able to share this knowledge with him, and he greatly appreciated it!</p>
