                <p>My Thinking Style as suggested by the thinking style quiz is a mix of Abstract Random and Concrete Random.  One characteristic of this thinking style is a strong desire for healthy relationships.  I agree I often learn best when in community and in dialogue.  For that reason, I will try to keep the lines of communication flowing when I don't understand something and need help or when I have something to share.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I believe original ideas often come into being by merging two often very different ideas.  In a sense, the partnering is random.  Since I have a tendency toward random thinking, I will do my best to offer creative solutions and creative project proposals when working with a team.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I will utilize my study of Nonviolent Communication to try to hear fully the feelings, needs, and requests of people I am working with and to express myself in a compassionate way.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>The biggest struggle for me in Phase 0 has been applying what I have read.  For this reason, I have reached out to my accountability group and cohort when I do not understand something.  I think part of my difficulty comes from the fact that so much of this information is completely new to me so it's hard for me to integrate it into a broader understanding.  I believe as I learn more about coding, learning about coding will become easier because I will have a stronger foundation and greater context for new knowledge.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I am committed to having a growth mindset.  For this reason, I am open to expressing my ignorance and asking for help when I need it.  I'm also trying to apply organizational techniques to bring more structure to how I work.  Related to the structure of how I work, I recently downloaded a Pomodoro app so I can bring better focus to my work time by allocating break time.  I'm using it right now!</p>
