                <p>Ok.  I just watched Shereef's fireside chat and I was really impressed.  Smart guy.  I feel a thrilling sense of adventure.  I really liked his restaurant v. kitchen analogy.  I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and see what I can get up to.  I do have a tinkering mind and I care deeply about human connection and empathy.  I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by how much I need to learn in just my first few days online.</p>

                <p>I recognized early on that it's really true, you have to take your education into you own hands at DBC.  This is not something where the teacher is going to take you through everything step by step.  This is a situation in which the teacher is going to challenge you and it is up to you to find a way to learn what you need using the resources available.  I feel like I could do well in this environment.  There are so many resources available including tutoring, peer paring, office hours, provided resources, and the whole universe Google provides.</p>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Already I am learning so much.  Even though I feel like I'm behind, I recognize that I am doing things that just a few days ago I did not know how to do.  I didn't even know some of this stuff was possible.  I have confidence that DBC has selected creative, kindhearted people and I look forward to working with them in person.  I've already gotten to know everyone in my Accountability Group online and I found them to be very generous and extremely helpful.</p>

                <p>I think I'm a guy who is in the category of wondering if this is going to be too much for me.  Did they select the right student?  Sometimes the fear can be paralyzing but then I remember to breathe and start taking steps.  Small steps will work.  I am hopeful that if I put in the time and effort this will be a powerfully transformative and invigorating experience for me.  I have a good feeling it's going to be delicious!</p>
