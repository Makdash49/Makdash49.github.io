                <p>This is one of my favorite sites because it has the kind of news that I enjoy: news about upcoming movies.  The first thing my eye is drawn to when I visit this site is the animation up in the top left corner.  There is always an animation featuring the creator of the site Harry.  It shows him in a scene from a classic or new movie with a twist. I describe this website as cluttered.  It's hard to know where to look.  The side bar or the center bar.  This took some getting used to on my part but I eventually learned that I care mostly about the center bar so that is where I usually go when I vist the site.  But the site is not just cluttered, it's also whimsical and fun.  From the homepage you can pretty much find any recent stories.  Once you click on them, there isn't much opportunity to click deeper.  Essentially, the website is only one layer deep, unless you are looking for old stuff.  I usually feel pretty jazzed after I visit this site because I've watched a few trailers for upcoming movies or learned a couple of potential spoilers.  In a way this site sells movies, and I have been to a few.  But lately I have been so busy that I don't actually watch many movies.  It's crazy but most of my movie pleasure I get is from this website reading about movies.</p>

                <p>This is a very uncluttered website.  I think that's how they made a name for themselves at Google.  Having a main page that is completely uncluttered.  My page here is inspired by their aesthetic.  Their website just says Google and has a field for searching.  Actually, Google occasionally has a differently designed Google logo right in the middle which celebrates something happening that day, like an anniversary of an important event.  Once you type something in, you can pretty much go anywhere on the web.</p>

                <p>Ha ha ha ha ha!  Just thinking about this website makes me laugh!  It's a parody of news websites.  My page here is inspired by their humor.  This page is like a parody of the fine website other DBC students have put together.  Once I catch up on the course materials and have a better sense of what the hell I'm doing, I will come back and make this look spiffy.  Enough about me.  The Onion.  It doesn't really sell anything except for Onion hats and mugs and a few knicknacks.  I did buy an Onion book once so I have paid for something.  They also have advertisements.</p>
