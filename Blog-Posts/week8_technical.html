                <p>Rails is short for "Ruby on Rails" and is a web application framework.  It is open source and written in Ruby.  Rails provides a basic development environment to facilitate the creation of web applications and websites.  For instance, it can construct some of the views and models needed for a website.  This is called scaffolding.  Rails includes a Ruby web server called WEBrick and a build system called Rake.  
                <br><br>
                Rails adheres to two principles:  "Convention over Configuration" and "Don't Repeat Yourself," CoC and DRY respectively.  "Convention over Configuration" means that there are number of conventions built into the framework.  For instance, a table will automatically be named in a way that references the class it belongs to.  If you don't want the table to be named in this convention, it is up to you to change it.  By adhering to this convention less code is needed and there is less repetition.  "Don't Repeat Yourself" means just that.  Create code that is efficient and does not repeat the same information or algorithms unless necessary.  One way Rails does this is it can retrieve database column information based on the class name rather than needing to specify the column names in class definitions.  It does this using the ActiveRecord module.
                <br><br>
                According to Wikipedia, "As of May 2014, it is estimated that more than 600,000 web sites are running Ruby on Rails."  Top websites running on rails include GitHub, Yammer, Shopify, Hulu and Basecamp.</p>
