                <h4>Can tech be part of the solution?</h4>

                <p>My biggest concern about tech is it's impact on the environment.  Valuable minerals are mined in order to manufacture computers and smart phones.  Energy goes into the production of these manchines.  Then these products are thrown away and they contain some hazardous materials including mercury that can dramatically pollute the environment.</p>
                <p>Hopefully manufacters can find ways to completely reuse the materials inside computers so that they don't need to be mined in extremely destructive and inhumane ways.  Hopefully, tech can find ways to build computers locally so that less energy for transporting the computers to the users will be spent.</p>
                <p>Through the internet, computers are raising consciousness about the environmental threat we face as a civilization.  Unfortunately, computers also contribute to that threat.  It's going to be interesting to see if the connectivity and knowledge we gain through computers will outweigh the environmentally destructive characteristics of the tech industry.</p>
