                 <h4>What is SQL Injection?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>SQL injection is a method of hacking the databases of organizations through the fields on their websites that are meant to being populated by the public.  Hackers enter SQL commands into forms and then gain access to the database and are able to read and even delete tables.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Why is that bad?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>This is a major problem because hackers can access information that is meant to be private.  This could include credit card numbers or any sensitive information.  If a hacker deletes tables from a database that can cause untold harm to a company when those records are lost.</p>

                <h4>How Do New Programmers Prevent SQL Injection?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>There are a number of ways beginning programmers can protect against SQL Injection.  Here are two:</p>

                <p>1.  Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries) <br>This means that a field will only accept a pre-determined input statements.  If a user tries to enter a statement that is not approved, it will not be accepted.</p>

                <p>2.  Escaping All User Supplied Input <br>This means that user input does not have access to the database.  It is first rewritten into sanitized prepared statements that are safe.  Unfortunately, this approach can have a negative effect on performance and can be troublesome to retrofit.</p>
