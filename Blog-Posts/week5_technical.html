                <h4>Classes of Spaceships</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Classes are a way of defining objects so that you can create instances of a class and then call those instances with methods defined as part of the class.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Here's an example:</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>We could define a class called:  spaceships <br>
                    This class would take arguments as parameters such as:  purpose, speed, crew-size.  Then you would want to initialize these variables so that they can be used in all the methods of the class.  You do this by using the "@" symbol which means this is an instance variable.  You initialize a method like this:</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>def initialize (purpose, speed, crew)<br>  
                @purpose = purpose<br>
                @speed = speed<br>
                @crew = crew</p>
            </div> 

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>To later create instances of class you would name it like this while passing in arguments:<br><br>
                x-wing = spaceships.new(fighter, hyperspace, 1)<br>
                space_shuttle = spaceships.new(science, mach 10, 8)<br>
                borg_cube = spaceships.new(domination, Warp 9, 100,000)</p>
            </div>                         

            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Now that we have some instances it would be nice to be able to call some methods on them, for instance:<br><br>

                x-wing.function<br>
                borg_cube.population<br>
                space_shuttle.kessel_run<br>
                Back in the body of the class spaceship you define these methods.<br><br>

                For instance:<br><br>

                def population<br>
                if crew < 2<br>
                puts "It's lonely in space.  No one can hear you scream, or sneeze, or even yawn for that matter."<br>
                elsif crew < 50<br>
                puts "Sounds like a nice Sunday Drive."<br>
                else<br>
                puts "What is this?  The Love Boat?!"<br>
                end<br>
                end<br><br>

                So this is what would happen:<br><br>

                x-wing.population => "It's lonely in space.  No one can hear you scream, or sneeze, or even yawn for that matter."<br><br>

                borg_cube.population => "What is this?  The Love Boat?!"<br><br>

                space_shuttle.population => "Sounds like a nice Sunday Drive."<br><br>


                * I should mentioned that Ruby has some built in classes like Array which you can modify in a program.
