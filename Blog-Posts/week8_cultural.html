                <p>I had an emotional conflict with my sister Sarah when I was making plans to visit her and her family in Dallas.  She and I were on the phone and we had just finalized when I would visit when she told me, "Now whatever you do, do not tell mom you are coming to see me.  If she hears you are visiting, then she will make plans to visit too."
                <br><br>
                Surprised by this I asked my sister, "Are you telling me to lie to mom?  What I am supposed to tell her if she asks?  She will get upset when she finds out if we keep it from her.  I think it's better to tell her.
                <br><br>
                To which my sister replied, "Oh no!  Promise me you won't tell her!  Whatever you do don't tell her!"
                <br><br>
                I responded with, "You're gonna put me in hot water!  She's gonna be mad at me when she finds out.  I can't believe you're telling me to lie to mom!"
                <br><br>
                "Don't lie to her...  Just don't tell her!  She just visited a few months ago and now I want you to visit."
                <br><br>
                "But what will I say when I talk with her?  Pretend like I am not coming to visit you?  What if she asks about my plans?"
                <br><br>
                "Just don't tell her!"
                <br><br>
                The conversation went around and around like this for awhile and it was getting quite emotional and there didn't seem to be a way to resolve it.  Then I remembered a lesson I learned in a Nonviolent Communication class.  An effective step in resolving a conflict is to make sure that everyone involved feels heard.  I realized that I was putting all my energy into explaining to my sister why not telling mom didn't work for me and she was putting all her energy into insisting that I not tell mom.  So I paused for a second and took a breath and made a conscious choice to shift gears.
                <br><br>
                Then I said, "Ok.  I think I know where you're coming from.  Mom sometimes visits without warning and when she does it can be stressful.  She wants to spend a lot of time with the kids and it can take a lot of your energy being a host to her.  If she finds out I'm coming, she might think that it would be a good time for her to visit too.  It would be great for me to have a chance to spend quality time with you and your family."
                <br><br>
                To which Sarah replied, "Yeah, that's right.  Exactly."  She sighed and paused a second and then said, "But I know where you're coming from too.  You don't want to lie to mom and you don't want to her get mad at you when she finds out.  You know what, it'll be Ok.  You can tell her."
                <br><br>
                I was surprised!  "Are you sure?"
                <br><br>
                "Yeah, it'll be OK."
                <br><br>
                To which I replied.  "You know, I think so.  It'll be Ok.  I'll let her know that I am looking forward to spending some quality brother-sister time with you, and uncle time with the kids."
                <br><br>
                Not long after that conversation, I talked with my mom and told her with sensitivity that I would be visiting Sarah.  She understood and I ended up having a great visit to Dallas.
                <br><br>
                The source of the conflict was Sarah's need to have a peaceful, stress-fee home and to have a personal and quality visit with me.  The problem was her strategy for meeting this need involved me not meeting my needs to be honest with my mom and to avoid having her be upset with me.
                <br><br>
                I handled this conflict by first expressing why Sarah's strategy didn't work for me.  It was important to do this but when I kept doing this, she kept insisting that I not tell mom.  This was not getting us anywhere.  If anything, we were both getting increasingly upset and frustrated with each other.
                <br><br>
                But then I shifted to understanding and empathizing with her position.  Miraculously, when she sensed my care for her and my appreciation for where she was coming from, she was better able to understand where I was coming from.  Then she found the flexibility in herself to move forward in a way that cared for both of us.  She was willing to risk that my mom might want to come too.  In the end I was able to express to my mom that I wanted to spend some brother-sister time with Sarah, and it all worked out.
                <br><br>
                If I could go back and do this differently, I would have shifted to understanding and empathy sooner so that we would not have gotten so frustrated with each other.  (It would be wonderful to go back because my sister Sarah passed away in February.  It would be nice to have a loving conversation with her.  In a way, writing this blog feels like going back so it has been very worthwhile.)
                <br><br>
                From this experience I learned that when people are in conflict and are going head to head and keep expressing their points of view in a way that seem to oppose each other, progress is very hard to make.  When one person takes the time to receive fully what the other person is saying, it may encourage the other person to do the same.  Then the people can realize that they are actually trying to create a resolution that cares for everyone.  At that point it becomes easier for people to be flexible and creative so that a solution can be found.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately, I didn't resort to the behaviors in the Compass of Shame which are:  Attack Other, Withdraw, Attack Self, Avoidance.  I could have said, "Sarah you are being ridiculous!"  Or I could have just changed the subject and not been true to myself.  Or I could have said "I'm such a disloyal brother since I don't do what my sister tells me."  Or I could have gotten off the phone and had some beers to forget about it.
                <br><br>
                I am glad that I try to understand myself and what motivates me.  I was clear what needs of mine I wanted to ensure were met, and eventually I became more clear about what needs Sarah needed met.  Through compassion we were able to resolve the conflict in a way that was caring to everyone.</p>
