                <p>There are a few general principles that I believe can be helpful if you want to ask a question that will be effective at getting an answer.
                <br><br>
                1.  Write a succinct and clear question title.  If the format does not include titles, make sure your first sentence gets to the point in a way that is easy to understand what you want.
                <br><br>
                2.  Give some context.  It's important for the person reading to understand what you are talking about so a little backstory can be very helpful.  But not so much that the point of what you're asking get's lost.  It's a balance.
                <br><br>
                3.  Include a problem statement that includes what you want.  When people know what you want it is easier for them to help you make sure you get it.
                <br><br>
                4.  Include some sample code and data.  Again, a balance.  Not so much that the point is lost but enough to see what is going on.
                <br><br>
                5.  Use professional spelling, grammar and formatting.  People are more likely to help someone who is able to communicate clearly and appears to have a clue.
                <br><br>
                I have asked some questions recently.
                <br><br>
                For instance, I asked my girlfriend Sonia how she knew which train to get on in the New York subway.  Admittedly, this was a bit of a vague question and I got an answer that didn't really make sense to me.  Sonia started telling me about how the trains were just like San Francisco and there were different lines that went different places and made different stops.  I tried looking at the lighted display on the wall of the train but that didn't make sense to me either.  I did notice that the place we were at was not on the display.  Sonia pointed out that this display was not for the train we were on.  
                <br><br>
                I was still pretty confused.  When leaving the station I saw an information booth and asked a question that did the trick.  "Do you have a map of the subway system?"  She did and she gave it to me.  This helped some but when I looked at it, I still felt pretty overwhelmed and confused.
                <br><br>
                Finally, I hit on the question that made everything clear.  I asked my Sonia, "How do you know which trains stop at which stations?"  She explained that the map included little numbers by the station names that expressed which trains stopped there. Ahhhhh. I hadn't seen those before.  It was as if they suddenly popped into existence. Now it all made sense and I understood why we had gotten off the green line at a station only to get back on the green line with a different number.
                <br><br>
                Now in the pursuit of asking effective questions I've had a look at the questions posted to the August Stars Google group.  Two of them caught my attention and I will share them here with my comments.
                <br><br>
                Question 1:  Any suggestions on a good place with wifi to meetup and work on projects in San Francisco? Preferably close to a BART station.
                <br><br>
                This is a good question.  It explains the intention right away, to find a place to meet up, and the requirements, that the place have wifi and be in San Francisco.  The asker could have been more specific about what part of San Francisco but I think it's safe to assume he means downtown or in the Mission.  Also, he doesn't specify what kind of a place.  A cafe or a tech hub?  But again, I think the open ended nature of the question leave room for different answers.  So far, no one has answered the question but then again it has only been a few hours since it was posted.
                <br><br>
                Question 2:  I seem to be having trouble with the 'Count the numbers in an array between the given range' exercise. Any input and feedback would be helpful as I'm quite baffled by what they want. Thanks
                <br><br>
                This question is also good although it took a little while for me to realize what the asker needed exactly.  It's not clear in a specific way from the first sentence or most of the second sentence.  It only becomes clear when the asker states, "I'm quite baffled by what they want."  It would have been more clear to ask in the first sentence, "Can someone please tell me what "Count the Numbers" question is asking for, and what I need to provide to answer it?"  It looks like someone did respond to this question but they responded with a question themselves.  "What have you tried thus far?"  In the end, the asker had already figured it out themselves so I guess they were able to answer their own question, which is a credit to their question and their investigative ability.  
                <br><br>
                As a closing thought, I will just say that in my study of Nonviolent Communication I have learned that when trying to ask people to help you, it is most effective to be specific as specific as you can about what you want them to do.  That way they can easily decide if they want to or not.  It's hard to say yes if you're not sure what you're saying yes to.</p>
