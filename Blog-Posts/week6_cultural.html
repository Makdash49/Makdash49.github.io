                 <h4>What is Stereotype Threat?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Claude M. Steele developed a theory called Stereotype Threat which explains minority underachievement and is supported by scientific studies.  In a nutshell, when people perform certain skills that they believe they are not well suited to doing well because they belong to a group that is known for not performing those skills well, they get nervous and less motivated.  This results in them actually performing worse in these tests.  The opposite can also be true.  People who believe they belong to a group who perform certain skills well, do better when tested on these skills.</p>

                <h4>Strategies to Combat Stereotype Threat</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>The way tests are written can have an impact on stereotype threat.  If questions about gender and ethnicity can be held off until the end of the test, this can help eliminate stereotype threat.  Tests can also be worded not to imply that women, or men or different ethnic groups perform certain skills with different proficiency.  Also test takers can be encouraged to think of their own unique characteristics as a human being rather than as a member of a demographic group.  On the whole, I think greater dialogue about this issue can bring it into the light and help people realize what is happening.  Just knowing about it will help combat it.  Our culture needs to change.  The way to do that is through dialogue and by highlighting the achievements of members of demographic groups so that other members can be inspired by what is possible.</p>

                <h4>My Experience with Stereotype Threat</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>When I was in 5th grade I lived in England and I was struggling academically.  Then I moved back to an American community in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  Although, I didnt believe I had an english accent, many of my classmates thought I did and told me I sounded very smart.  This did wonders for my academic self-esteem and I started doing better in school.  I thought of this experience when I learned about stereotype threat.  Just believing that you have the potential to do better makes it possible to do better.  When I was in 7th grade I had a science teacher who expected a lot from his students.  Just the fact that he did not let us off the hook if we believed we were not good at science motivated us.<br><br>Now that I am in Dev Bootcamp I am facing stereotype threat.  The threat of being an older beginning hacker.  Iâ€™m 41 and I worry that this is pretty old for a person just learning to code.  I found myself concerned that I would not be able to learn as well as some of my younger cohort mates.  I am hopeful that being conscious of this thought process and how it relates to stereotype threat will help me perform at an excellent level.  Mainly I need to remember that I can do very well and that determination and persistence matter more than demographics.</p>
