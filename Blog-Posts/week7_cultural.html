                <h6>August 10, 2014</h6>
                <h4>Release 1:  When you think of the times in your life where you have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Accomplishment, Caring, Peace, Environmentalism, Humor, Romance</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 2:  Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I care about peace because humanity faces a number of urgent social justice and environmental challenges, and I believe we will need to engage in peaceful and productive dialogue to address these challenges.  That is why I am a student on Nonviolent Communication.  NVC offers strategies of communication with a core emphasis on empathy and cooperation.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 3:  In general, I try to live up to these values:  4.5</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 4:  What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Several people asked for my advice last night as I ate a burrito on the bench outside the new El Barrio Burritos restaurant in Brooklyn.  They wanted to know if I was enjoying the burrito and if I recommended they get one.  I told them, I like burritos and it is a burrito, so I am enjoying it.  If you like burritos, get a burrito. </p>
            </div>    
            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 5a:  How do you feel when you think about your values? </h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>I feel grounded and centered.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 5b:  Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? </h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Maybe.  It might remind me of who I am at the core rather than the stereotypes others or myself might assign to me.  I will have to give it a try.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="paragraph_title">
                <h4>Release 5c:  Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h4>
            </div>
            
            <div id="paragraph_content">
                <p>Yes.  Exercises.  Like jumping jacks, jogging in place, jogging in the park, pushups, sit-ups.  Anything to get the blood pumping and the breath moving.  Help clear out the system.  Also, embracing the beauty of nature can bring a sense of wellness.</p>
